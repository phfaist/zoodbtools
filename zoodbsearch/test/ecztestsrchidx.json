An \\([[n,k,d]]\\) stabilizer code admitting a set of stabilizer generators that are either \\(Z\\)-type or \\(X\\)-type Pauli strings. The stabilizer generator matrix is of the form \\begin{align}\nH=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & H_{Z}\\\\\nH_{X} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\label{eq:parity}\n\\tag*{(1)}\\end{align} such that the rows of the two blocks must be orthogonal \\begin{align}\nH_X H_Z^T=0~.\n\\label{eq:comm}\n\\tag*{(2)}\\end{align} The above condition guarantees that the \\(X\\)-stabilizer generators, defined in the symplectic representation as rows of \\(H_X\\), commute with the \\(Z\\)-stabilizer generators associated with \\(H_Z\\).\n\n[figure]\n    One\n    Two\n    Three\n    1\n    2\n    3\n\n\nEncoding is based on two related binary linear codes, an \\([n,k_X,d^\\prime_X]\\) code \\(C_X\\) and \\([n,k_Z,d^\\prime_Z]\\) code \\(C_Z\\), satisfying \\(C_X^\\perp \\subseteq C_Z\\). The resulting CSS code has \\(k=k_X+k_Z-n\\) logical qubits and distance \\(d\\geq\\min\\{d^\\prime_X,d^\\prime_Z\\}\\). The \\(H_X\\) (\\(H_Z\\)) block of \\(H\\) (1) is the parity-check matrix of the code \\(C_X\\) (\\(C_Z\\)). The requirement \\(C_X^\\perp \\subseteq C_Z\\) guarantees (2). Basis states for the code are, for \\(\\gamma \\in C_X\\), \\begin{align}\n|\\gamma + C_Z^\\perp \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|C_Z^\\perp|}} \\sum_{\\eta \\in C_Z^\\perp} |\\gamma + \\eta\\rangle.\n\\tag*{(3)}\\end{align}\n\nA CSS code has stabilizer weight \\(w\\) if the highest weight of any stabilizer generator is \\(w\\), i.e., any row of \\(H_X\\) and \\(H_Z\\) has weight at most \\(w\\). In the context of comparing weight as well as of determining distances for noise models biased toward \\(X\\)- or \\(Z\\)-type errors, an extended notation for asymmetric CSS codes is \\([[n,k,(d_X,d_Z),w]]\\) or \\([[n,k,d_X/d_Z,w]]\\). The quantity \\(\\min\\{d_X,d_Z\\}\\) is often called the worst-case minimum distance.\n\nCSS-to-homology correspondence\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCSS-to-homology correspondence: CSS codes and their properties can be formulated in terms of homology theory, yielding a powerful correspondence between codes and chain complexes, the primary homological structures. There exists a many-to-one mapping from size three chain complexes to CSS codes [A. Y. Kitaev, “Quantum computations: algorithms and error correction”, Russian Mathematical Surveys 52, 1191 (1997) DOI][H. Bombin and M. A. Martin-Delgado, “Homological error correction: Classical and quantum codes”, Journal of Mathematical Physics 48, (2007) arXiv:quant-ph/0605094 DOI][S. Bravyi and M. B. Hastings, “Homological Product Codes”, (2013) arXiv:1311.0885][N. P. Breuckmann, “PhD thesis: Homological Quantum Codes Beyond the Toric Code”, (2018) arXiv:1802.01520] that allows one to extract code properties from topological features of the complexes. Codes constructed in this manner are sometimes called homological CSS codes, but they are equivalent to CSS codes. This mapping of codes to manifolds allows the application of structures from topology to error correction, yielding various QLDPC codes with favorable properties.\n\nA chain complex of size three is given by binary vector spaces \\(A_2\\), \\(A_1\\), \\(A_0\\) and binary matrices \\(\\partial_{i=1,2}\\) (called boundary operators) \\(A_i\\) to \\(A_{i-1}\\) that satisfy \\(\\partial_1 \\partial_2 = 0\\). Such a complex is typically denoted as \\begin{align}\nA_2 \\xrightarrow{\\partial_2} A_1 \\xrightarrow{\\partial_1} A_0~.\n\\label{eq:chain}\n\\tag*{(4)}\\end{align} One constructs a CSS code by associating a physical qubit to every basis element of \\(A_1\\), and defining parity-check matrices \\(H_X=\\partial_1^T\\) and \\(H_Z=\\partial_2\\)). That way, the spaces \\(A_0\\) and \\(A_2\\) can be associated with \\(X\\)-type and \\(Z\\)-type Pauli operators, respectively, and boundary operators determine the Paulis making up the stabilizer generators. The requirement \\(\\partial_1 \\partial_2 = 0\\) guarantees that the \\(X\\)-stabilizer generators associated with \\(H_X\\) commute with the \\(Z\\)-stabilizer generators associated with \\(H_Z\\).\n\nUsually, the chain complex (4) used in the construction comes from the chain complex associated with a cellulation of a manifold. When the manifold is a two-dimensional surface, its entire chain is used. Higher-dimensional manifolds allow for longer chain complexes, and one can use the three largest non-trivial vector spaces in its chain.","An \\((n,2^k,d)\\) linear code is denoted as \\([n,k]\\) or \\([n,k,d]\\), where \\(d\\) is the code's distance. Its codewords form a linear subspace, i.e., for any codewords \\(x,y\\), \\(x+y\\) is also a codeword. A code that is not linear is called nonlinear.\n\nLinear codes can be defined in terms of a generator matrix \\(G\\), whose rows form a basis for the \\(k\\)-dimensional codespace. Given a message \\(x\\), the corresponding encoded codeword is \\(G^T x\\). The generator matrix can be reduced via coordinate permutations to its standard or systematic form \\(G = [I_k~A]\\), where \\(I_k\\) is a \\(k\\times k\\) identity matrix and \\(A\\) is a \\(k \\times (n-k)\\) binary matrix.","Encodes \\(K\\)-dimensional Hilbert space into a \\(2^n\\)-dimensional (i.e., \\(n\\)-qubit) Hilbert space. Usually denoted as \\(((n,K))\\) or \\(((n,K,d))\\), where \\(d\\) is the code's distance.","An \\(((n,2^k,d))\\) stabilizer code is denoted as \\([[n,k]]\\) or \\([[n,k,d]]\\), where \\(d\\) is the code's distance. Logical subspace is the joint \\(+1\\) eigenspace of a set of \\(2^{n-k}\\) commuting Pauli operators forming the code's stabilizer group. The distance is the minimum weight of a Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation on the code.","A family of stabilizer codes whose generators are few-body \\(X\\)-type and \\(Z\\)-type Pauli strings associated to the stars and plaquettes, respectively, of a tessellation of a two-dimensional surface (with a qubit located at each edge of the tesselation). Toric code often either refers to the construction on the two-dimensional torus or is an alternative name for the general construction. The construction on surfaces with boundaries is often called the planar code [S. B. Bravyi and A. Yu. Kitaev, “Quantum codes on a lattice with boundary”, (1998) arXiv:quant-ph/9811052].","Here is the code's description. It can span multiple, hard-wrapped lines. It can include citations [V. V. Albert, J. P. Covey, and J. Preskill, “Robust Encoding of a Qubit in a Molecule”, Physical Review X 10, (2020) arXiv:1911.00099 DOI].
