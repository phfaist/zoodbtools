","An LDPC code whose parity-check matrix has a fixed number of entries for each row or column. ","LDPC code whose parity-check matrix is constructed by \"spatially\" coupling several copies of a regular LDPC parity-check matrix in chain-like fashion (or, more generally, in grid-like fashion) to yield a band matrix.

Efficiency of the verification is quantified by the code's query complexity \\(u\\), while effectiveness is quantified by the code's soundness \\(R\\).\n\nTypically, one looks at how \\(R\\) scales with increasing code size for infinite families of codes, defining LTC families as those for which the soundness is asymptotically constant. Such LTC families with asymptotically constant distance, rate, and query complexity are called \\(c^3\\)-LTCs. The first two such families are classical codes arising from the expander lifted-product quantum code construction and left-right Cayley complex codes.\n\nA technical definition for codes over binary alphabets is provided as follows; for general alphabets, see Ref. [O. Goldreich, “Short Locally Testable Codes and Proofs: A Survey in Two Parts”, Property Testing 65 (2010) DOI]. The idea behind LTCs is to be able to reliably test whether a given bit-string \\(x\\) is in the code by only sampling subsets of \\(u\\) bits. To have something to check against, we first have to define a collection of length-\\(u\\) subsets \\(S\\) of bit locations that are called allowed local views. A code is an LTC if the following two conditions are satisfied [I. Dinur et al., “Locally Testable Codes with constant rate, distance, and locality”, (2021) arXiv:2111.04808; Thm. 1.1].\n\nFirst, if \\(x\\) is a codeword, then all of its restrictions \\(x|_S\\) to the subsets \\(S\\) are allowed local views, \\begin{align}\n  x\\in C \\Rightarrow x|_S \\in \\{\\text{allowed local views}\\}~.\n\\tag*{(1)}\\end{align} This guarantees that codewords can indeed be determined from this limited sampling procedure.\n\nSecond, the probability that a given restriction is not an allowed local view is lower-bounded by the relative distance to the code, \\begin{align}\n  \\text{Pr}_S (x|_S\\text{ not allowed local view}) \\geq \\frac{R}{n} D(x,C)~,\n\\tag*{(2)}\\end{align} where \\(D(x,C)\\) is the Hamming distance between \\(x\\) and the closest codeword to \\(x\\). This condition ensures that strings \\(x\\) can be deemed to be not in the codespace with high probability, i.e., with probability increasing as \\(x\\) gets farther from the code.","Code whose construction is non-deterministic in some way, i.e., codes that utilize an elements of randomness somewhere in their construction. Members of this class range from fully non-deterministic codes, to codes whose multi-step construction is deterministic with the exception of a single step.\n\nTypically, random codes are selected with uniform distribution from some ensemble of codes. For example, a random binary code is a set of \\(2^{K}\\) codewords with length \\(N\\) chosen uniformly from the ensemble of all \\(2^N\\) bit-strings. Each bit in the codeword is randomly chosen between 0 and 1 with equal probability. For another example, a random binary linear code is generated from a random chosen \\(K\\) generators of length \\(N\\), where each bit of the generators is randomly chosen between 0 and 1 with equal probability. Equivalently, a random binary linear code is defined by a randomly generated \\(K\\) by \\(N\\) generator matrix, where each entry is randomly chosen between 0 and 1 with equal probability.\n\nIn both of the above random code constructions, the ensemble size scales exponentially with \\(N\\). A common convention is to think of the resulting code constructions as effectively explicit (as opposed to random) in cases where the ensemble size is independent of \\(N\\) or even when the size scales polynomially with \\(N\\).","Binary or \\(q\\)-ary code constructed from an algebraic curve of some genus over a finite field via the evaluation construction, the residue construction, or more general constructions that yield nonlinear codes.

The curve can be defined over affine space or projective space, which contains the affine coordinates as a subset and which can yield an increase in length. If evaluations are made over projective coordinates, then the codewords are evaluations of homogeneous polynomials, and there are relations between such polynomials with polynomials over affine space.

A cyclic code is called primitive when \\(n=q^r-1\\) for some \\(r\\geq 2\\).

Codewords \\(c_1 c_2 \\cdots c_n\\) of a cyclic \\(q\\)-ary code can be thought of as coefficients in a polynomial \\(c_1+c_2 x+\\cdots+c_n x^{n-1}\\) in the set of polynomials with \\(q\\)-ary coefficients, \\(\\mathbb{F}_q[x]\\) with \\(\\mathbb{F}_q=GF(q)\\).

Multiplication of a codeword polynomial \\(c(x)\\) by \\(x\\) in such a ring corresponds to a cyclic shift of the corresponding codeword string.\n\nCodeword polynomials of a cyclic code can be generated, via multiplication, by a generator polynomial \\(g(x)\\). A particular generator polynomial \\(e(x)\\) has the additional property of being idempotent, i.e., \\(e(x)^2=e(x)\\). Given a generator polynomial, the corresponding check polynomial \\(h(x)=(x^n-1)/g(x)\\) yields zero when multiplying a codeword polynomial. Its coefficients correspond to the code's parity check matrix.\n\nSince the generator polynomial \\(g(x)\\) is a polynomial over \\(GF(q)\\), it can be factorized over some potentially larger splitting field (just like \\(x^2+1\\) can be factorized over the complex numbers but not the reals). Whenever \\(q\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime, cyclic codes can also be defined in terms of roots of \\(g(x)\\). Such roots are called zeroes of the code, and they are all powers of a primitive \\(n\\)th root of unity because \\(g(x)\\) is a divisor of \\(x^n-1\\). Since the generator polynomial generates all codeword polynomials \\(c(x)\\) by multiplication by \\(x\\), its zeroes are also zeroes of those polynomials.","Member of a pair of cyclic linear binary codes that satisfy certain relations, depending on whether the pair is even-like or odd-like duadic.

Such qudit-into-oscillator stabilizer codes are GKP and multimode GKP codes.\n\nStabilizer codewords encoding a logical oscillator (i.e., CV quantum information) admit either a discrete or a continuous stabilizer group. The former, called GKP-stabilizer codes, are obtained from multimode GKP codes by removing stabilizer generators for some of the modes.

A single-shot code is a block quantum code admitting a fault-tolerant error-correcting protocol that does not \"fail too badly\" when faced with noisy syndrome measurements.\n\nThe property typically implies that a sufficiently large number of error-correction rounds will keep both (sufficiently low-weight) data and measurement errors bounded, as opposed to yielding eventually uncorrectable residual errors. The property is sufficient (but not necessary [N. Delfosse, B. W. Reichardt, and K. M. Svore, “Beyond Single-Shot Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction”, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 68, 287 (2022) arXiv:2002.05180 DOI]) to reduce the number of error-correction rounds required for fault-tolerant error correction. The word \"single\" refers to the ability to decode well using syndrome data from only one measurement round, i.e., without using syndrome data from previous rounds.\n\nIn the loosest form of the single-shot property for qubit, modular qudit, or Galois qudit codes, given some data error \\(e\\), ideal data error syndrome \\(s\\), and measurement error \\(m\\), there exists an error-correction protocol that outputs a correction \\(f\\) such that the Hamming weight of the residual error \\(e-f\\) is polynomial in the weight of \\(m\\).

A code admits \\((\\gamma,\\alpha)\\) linear confinement if the (stabilizer-reduced) weight of the syndrome is proportional to the (stabilizer-reduced) weight of the data error (for data errors of weight less than \\(\\gamma\\)) with proportionality constant \\(\\alpha\\). Linear confinement is sufficient for being single shot against local stochastic noise, and more general notions of confinement are sufficient for being single shot against adversarial noise [A. O.

The class of codes constructed using the framework depends on the choice of atomic lego blocks.\n\nThe individual lego blocks and resulting quantum lego codes can be stabilizer or non-stabilizer. However, both the logical and physical degrees of freedom must have the same local dimension.\n\nFor example, any stabilizer code can be built out of atomic blocks like the 2-site repetition code, single-site trivial stabilizer codes, and tensor products of the \\(|0\\rangle\\) state. Specifically, the HaPPY holographic code is a quantum Lego code whose atomic Lego block is the five-qubit perfect qubit code.\n\nMany known codes can be created using this code''s methods in order to further their understanding, including a 6 qubit implementaion of the generalized Bacon-Shor code, the Toric code, and the \\([[7,1,3]]\\) Steane code. For example, a simple \\( [[4,2,2]] \\) stabilizer code can be written as a rank 6 tensor. Attaching two of these via gluing together one logical leg from each can produce a \\( [[6,4,2]] \\) stabilizer code. Code optimization in this framework can be done using reinforcement learning [V. P. Su et al., “Discovery of Optimal Quantum Error Correcting Codes via Reinforcement Learning”, (2023) arXiv:2305.06378].\n\nTo construct a Lego code, the encoding map \\(V\\) for each code that is to be used in the construction is converted to a tensor by decomposing it using the formula \\begin{align}\nV = \\sum_{i_j} V_{i_1 \\ldots i_{n+k}} | i_{k+1} \\ldots i_{k+n} \\rangle \\langle i_1 \\ldots i_k |~.\n\\tag*{(1)}\\end{align} We then look at the codes graphically, treating each \\(i_j\\) as an edge dangling out of the tensor vertex \\(V_{i_1 \\ldots i_{n+k}}\\). These edges are either connected to another tensor vertex's edges or left dangling. If the block codes are stabilizer, then each local tensor has unitary product stabilizers (UPS). The goal is to push each UPS through the tensor network until each dangling edge has only trivial support. Otherwise, a matching value is pushed through the edge and the process is repeated on the next tensor. If a UPS can be pushed through the whole network, then a UPS for the larger network has been found. The dangling legs (edges) and UPS of the whole network can then be converted to physical/logical elements and stabilizers/logical operators for a new quantum code.","A code whose codewords make up the ground-state space of a fracton-phase Hamiltonian.","A code whose codewords form the ground-state or low-energy subspace of a code Hamiltonian realizing a topological phase.

Such a code is a \\((u,R)\\)-QLTC with soundness function \\(R(\\delta)\\in[0,1]\\) if \\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:qltc}\n  \\forall \\delta > 0,|\\psi\\rangle~:~\\text{dist}(|\\psi\\rangle,C) \\geq \\delta n \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{r}\\langle\\psi|H|\\psi\\rangle\\geq R(\\delta)~,\n\\tag*{(1)}\\end{align} where \\(\\text{dist}(|\\psi\\rangle,\\mathsf{C})\\) is a particular distance function between the state \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) and the codespace \\(\\mathsf{C}\\) [D. Aharonov and L. Eldar, “Quantum Locally Testable Codes”, (2013) arXiv:1310.5664; Def. 13]. The locality parameter \\(u\\) is called the query complexity of the code.\n\nA qubit, modular-qudit, or Galois-qudit stabilizer code that is locally testable is called a stabilizer locally testable code (SLTC). In other words, the code admits a set of \\(r\\) \\(u\\)-local stabilizer generators \\(S_i\\) whose corresponding code Hamiltonian \\(H=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^r I-S_i\\) satisfies the requirement of being QLTC.\n\nFor example, the \\([[n=2L^2,k=2,d=L]]\\) toric code on an \\(L\\times L\\) lattice is not a QLTC because of the following argument. Let \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) be a ground state that is excited by \\(L/3\\) Pauli strings, each of length \\(L/2\\). In order to fit on the lattice, such strings can, e.g., be horizontal and aligned next to each other in the vertical direction. The distance function \\(\\text{dist}(|\\psi\\rangle,\\mathsf{C})\\) is the weight of the smallest Pauli string that multiplies \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) to yield a state in the codespace. In this case, that weight is the same as the weight of the perturbing string, i.e., \\(L^2/6\\), requiring \\(\\delta = 1/12\\) to satisfy (1). There are \\(2L/3\\) violated Hamiltonian terms because each of the \\(L/3\\) strings violates only two stabilizer generators. However, there are \\(r = 2(L^2-1)\\) stabilizer generators, so the implication of (1) is not satisfied for nonzero soundness as \\(L\\to\\infty\\) because \\(\\frac{1}{r}\\langle\\psi|H|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{2L/3}{2(L^2-1)}\\to 0\\).","Also called a self-correcting quantum memory or thermally stable encoding. A block quantum code that forms the ground-state subspace of an \\(n\\)-body geometrically local Hamiltonian whose logical information is recoverable for arbitrary long times in the \\(n\\to\\infty\\) limit after interaction with a sufficiently cold thermal environment. Typically, one also requires a decoder whose decoding time scales polynomially with \\(n\\) and a finite energy density. The original criteria for a self-correcting quantum memory, informally known as the Caltech rules [C. G.

J. Brown et al., “Quantum memories at finite temperature”, Reviews of Modern Physics 88, (2016) arXiv:1411.6643 DOI]. To test whether a system is self-correcting, an initial codeword \\(\\rho(0)\\) is evolved under the Davies Lindbladian and the code Hamiltonian (or, if we are to allow extra passive protection, the code Lindbladian) to the state \\(\\rho(t)\\) at time \\(t\\), after which it is decoded via decoding map \\(\\cal{D}\\).

A memory is partially self-correcting if \\(\\tau\\) scales polynomially with \\(n\\) up to some cutoff \\(n_{max}\\). A self-correcting memory is typically associated with a (stable) phase of quantum matter.","Also called a symmetry-protected self-correcting memory. An restricted notion of thermal stability against symmetric perturbations, i.e., perturbations that commute with a set of operators forming a group \\(G\\) called the symmetry group.\n\nGiven a symmetry group \\(G\\) and its unitary representation \\(S\\) on the \\(n\\)-site physical Hilbert space (in this case, a lattice), an operator \\(O\\) is \\(G\\)-symmetric (a.k.a. respects the \\(G\\) symmetry) if \\([S(g),O]=0\\) for all \\(g\\in G\\). A symmetry-protected self-correcting memory is a ground-state encoding of an \\(n\\)-body \\(G\\)-symmetric geometrically local Hamiltonian whose logical information is recoverable for arbitrary long times in the \\(n\\to\\infty\\) limit after a \\(G\\)-symmetric interaction with a thermal environment at sufficiently low temperature.\n\nTensor-product symmetries of the form \\(S(g)=u(g)^{\\otimes n}\\), where \\(u\\) is a unitary representation of \\(G\\ni g\\) on a site, cannot support symmetry-protected self-correction.

Quantum error-correcting codes have to protect against such phase-flip noise while also protecting against conventional classical bit-flip noise. Codes are not expected to protect against both types of noise perfectly, and there is generally a tradeoff.\n\nThe logical subspace is spanned by a basis comprised of code basis states or codewords.

Homology can be used to design codes for qubits, modular qudits, Galois qudits, as well as rotors; most codes are CSS codes. However, products can be of more than two underlying codes, in which case the output code need not be CSS (e.g., for XYZ-product codes).\n\nThe simplest product is a tensor product, with more general products imposing equivalence or symmetry relations on the outputs of the tensor product.

Haar-random codes are used to prove statements about the capacity of a quantum channel to transmit quantum information [“Preface to the Second Edition”, Quantum Information Theory xi (2016) arXiv:1106.1445 DOI], but encoding and decoding in such \\(n\\)-qubit codes quickly becomes impractical as \\(n\\to\\infty\\).\n\nThere are different approaches to create Haar-random codewords. In the construction of Ref. [P. Hayden et al., “A Decoupling Approach to the Quantum Capacity”, Open Systems &amp; Information Dynamics 15, 7 (2008) arXiv:quant-ph/0702005 DOI], codewords are produced by performing a unitarily covariant projective measurement on a typical subspace of a tensor-power state. Reference [P. Hayden et al., “A Decoupling Approach to the Quantum Capacity”, Open Systems &amp; Information Dynamics 15, 7 (2008) arXiv:quant-ph/0702005 DOI] showed that the capacity of a noisy quantum channel can be achieved by encoding in such Haar-random codes. In particular, Haar-random codes achieve perfect transmission in the \\(n\\to\\infty\\)) limit by proving that the encoded information becomes decoupled from the environment. This is a necessary and sufficient condition for successful decoding since measurements of the environment should never reveal the encoded information [B. Schumacher and M. A. Nielsen, “Quantum data processing and error correction”, Physical Review A 54, 2629 (1996) arXiv:quant-ph/9604022 DOI].\n\nIntuitively, coupling with the environment can be decreased by projecting the system onto a random codespace. The more qubits that are randomly discarded, the more the codespace is decoupled from the environment. One may ask what is the least amount of qubits that can be discarded, i.e. the largest remaining codespace, that still achieves decoupling. It can be shown through the decoupling inequality [M. Horodecki, J. Oppenheim, and A. Winter, “Quantum State Merging and Negative Information”, Communications in Mathematical Physics 269, 107 (2006) arXiv:quant-ph/0512247 DOI] that the largest possible dimension of the random codespace that achieves arbitrarily large decoupling is exponential in the coherent information of the channel. Therefore, there exist codes that can transmit information with rate equal to the coherent information. Furthermore, these codes can be constructed with high probability by performing a Haar-random isometry embedding a \\(k\\)-dimensional logical subspace into an \\(n\\)-dimensional physical space, where \\(k/n\\) is equal to the coherent information. Such an isometry can be produced by QR decomposition of a Gaussian random matrix [G. W.

An \\(n\\)-qubit quantum circuit with random two-qubit Clifford gates can act as an encoder into a code with distance \\(d\\) with high probability, with a size (i.e. number of gates in the circuit) at most \\(O(n^2 log n)\\)).

Stabilizer generators of 2D topological codes acting on 1D loops of qubits can be interpreted as one-form symmetries of the underlying phase realized by the code. Identification of an anyon \\(a\\) with the vacuum is equivalent to adding string excitation operators corresponding to \\(a\\) to the stabilizer group and taking the center to get another stabilizer group. Code states of this new stabilizer code correspond to a condensed phase of the parent topological phase. The remaining unidentified parent-phase anyons behave differently with respect to the new condensed-phase state. Some become confined while the remaining ones pick up new braiding relations.","Modular-qudit 2D subsystem stabilizer code whose low-energy excitations realize a non-modular anyon theory with \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\times\\mathbb{Z}_9\\) fusion rules.

Borello et al., “Dihedral Quantum Codes”, (2023) arXiv:2310.15092].","An \\(((n,K,d))_q\\) Galois-qudit code whose logical subspace is the joint eigenspace of commuting Galois-qudit Pauli operators forming the code's stabilizer group \\(\\mathsf{S}\\). Traditionally, the logical subspace is the joint \\(+1\\) eigenspace, and the stabilizer group does not contain \\(e^{i \\phi} I\\) for any \\(\\phi \\neq 0\\). The distance \\(d\\) is the minimum weight of a Galois-qudit Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.\n\nA Galois-qudit stabilizer code encoding an integer number of qudits (\\(K=q^k\\)) is denoted as \\([[n,k]]_q\\) or \\([[n,k,d]]_q\\). This notation differentiates between Galois-qudit and modular-qudit \\([[n,k,d]]_{\\mathbb{Z}_q}\\) stabilizer codes, although the same notation is usually used for both. Galois-qudit stabilizer codes need not encode an integer number of qudits, with \\(K=q^{n-\\frac{r}{m}}\\), where \\(r\\) is the number of generators of the stabilizer group, and \\(q=p^m\\) given prime \\(p\\) for all Galois qudits. As a result, \\([[n,k,d]]\\) notation is often used with non-integer \\(k=\\log_q K\\).\n\nGalois symplectic representation: The single Galois-qudit Pauli string \\(X_{a} Z_{b}\\) for \\(a,b\\in GF(q)\\) is converted to the vector \\(a|b\\).

The trace-symplectic inner product reduces to the symplectic inner product when the trace is removed, and a symplectic self-orthogonal set of vectors is automatically trace-symplectic self-orthogonal.\n\nAnother correspondence between Galos-qudit Pauli matrices and elements of the Galois field \\(GF(q^2)\\) yields the one-to-one correspondence between Galois-qudit stabilizer codes and trace-alternating self-orthogonal additive codes over \\(GF(q^2)\\) [A.

In other words, the set of \\(q\\)-ary vectors representing the stabilizer group is closed under both addition and multiplication by elements of \\(GF(q)\\). In contrast, Galois-qudit stabilizer codes admit sets of vectors that are closed under addition only.\n\nThe number of generators \\(r\\) for a true stabilizer code is a multiple of \\(m\\) (recall that \\(q=p^m\\) for Galois qudits). As a result, the number \\(k=n-r/m\\) of logical qudits is an integer.\n\nEach code can be represented by a stabilizer generator matrix \\(H=(A|B)\\), where each row \\((a|b)\\) is the Galois symplectic representation of a stabilizer generator.","An \\([[n,k,d]]_q\\) true Galois-qudit stabilizer code constructed from a Hermitian self-orthogonal linear code over \\(GF(q^2)\\) using the one-to-one correspondence between the Galois-qudit Pauli matrices and elements of the Galois field \\(GF(q^2)\\).\n\nGalois-qudit stabilizer codes are in one-to-one correspondence with trace-alternating self-orthogonal additive codes of length \\(n\\) over \\(GF(q^2)\\) via the \\(GF(q^2)\\) representation. Hermitian self-orthogonal linear codes over \\(GF(q^2)\\) are automatically trace-alternating self-orthogonal, and applying this mapping to such codes yields Hermitian codes [A.

If not, the use of flag qubits to detect hook errors may be necessary to yield fault-tolerant decoders.\nThe decoder determining the most likely error given a noise channel is called the maximum probability error (MPE) decoder. For few-qubit codes (\\(n\\) is small), MPE decoding can be based by creating a lookup table. For infinite code families, the size of such a table scales exponentially with \\(n\\), so approximate decoding algorithms scaling polynomially with \\(n\\) have to be used.\nDecoders are characterized by an effective distance or circuit-level distance, the minimum number of faulty operations during syndrome measurement that is required to make an undetectable error.

The primary noise channel for such signals is the additive Gaussian white-noise channel (AGWN), which adds a random Gaussian-distributed displacement with variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) to each signal point. Protection of a constellation thus depends on how far apart its points are in terms of the Euclidean distance. As usual, there is a tradeoff between packing of space and level of protection. For a given \\(n,M,P\\), the Gaussian channel coding problem asks to find a set of \\(M\\) codewords of norm \\(\\leq nP\\) that minimizes the error probability during transmission; see [J. H. Conway and N. J. A. Sloane, Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups (Springer New York, 1999) DOI; Ch. 3].\n\nThe minimum distance \\(d\\) of a constellation is the infimum over distances between any two of it''s points. The density \\(\\Delta\\) is the fraction of the total volume of space that is occupied by spheres of an optimal radius centered at each point in the sphere packing.

The thickness \\(\\Theta\\) (a.k.a. covering density or sparsity) of a covering is defined in the same way as the (packing) density, but with the spheres' covering radius now being the smallest one such that the spheres cover all space.\n\nThere is an upper bound on the thickness of a covering in dimensions \\(n>3\\) [C.
